**WARNING:** *This is not a fully functioning plugin (as of 13 Aug 2015).*

### What will Immerse.js do?

Immerse.js offers a javascript framework for building complex, media-driven web experiences. It:
* Solves complex scrolling problems, such as managing a mix of full screen sections and normal scrolling across all devices.
* Handles firing of GreenSock animations, custom js actions & attributes, with various runtime hooks, viewport and orientation parameters to tailor experiences across all screens.
* Enables the building of complex layered HTML5 audio soundtracks for each section of your page.
* Handles instantiation of resizable HTML5 background video - playing and pausing the video when in/out of view.
* Custom section components to manipulate content within each section of your page and remove the need for additional javascript. For example, tooltip, modal and slider support.
* Easy API to create custom section components.
* Manages asset preloading & page loading animations.
* Automatically generates & updates page section navigation.
* Provides an incredibly clean and simple interface to manage all of the above code.
